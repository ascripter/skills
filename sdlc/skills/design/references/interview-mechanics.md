# Interview mechanics — sdlc-design

Rules for running the question batches in Phase 6. Read this on entering
Phase 6. The mechanics are intentionally close to `sdlc:ux` and `sdlc:prd` so
users see one consistent interface across the pipeline; only design-specific
points are spelled out here.

## AskUserQuestion call format

Each batch is **one `AskUserQuestion` call** covering 2–4 questions (the tool's
hard limit is 4; single-question calls stall momentum). Per question:

```
header:   ≤ 12 chars — abbreviated theme label ("Axis A", "Aesthetic", "Tokens", "Assets", "Brief")
question: full text ending with "?"
options:  2–4 options ranked by relevance
multiSelect: true for list-typed fields
```

Option layout (the universal pattern):

| Position | Content |
|---|---|
| **1** | Recommended / `⚠ inferred` answer drawn from PRD/UX or the pre-fill map |
| **2–3** | Viable alternatives |
| **4** | Last explicit option. If more menu items exist, list them in this option's `description`: `"Also: <…>. Use the text field for any of these or your own."` |

The tool auto-adds an "Other" free-text entry; the user can type any value
there, including `EXIT`. For free-text-only questions (`suggested_answers: []`),
fill all positions with `⚠ inferred` suggestions drawn from PRD/UX/earlier
answers — never present an empty menu.

### EXIT handling

After every batch, check whether any field equals `EXIT` (case-insensitive)
before processing values. If so: write state `status: aborted`, flush
`partial_answers`, confirm to the user, stop.

## schema_path prefixes — which file an answer lands in

`design-questions.yaml` encodes the target file in each `schema_path` prefix.
Rewrite the prefix to the real path at runtime:

| Prefix | Target | Example |
|---|---|---|
| *(none)* | `docs/DESIGN.yaml` | `functional_structure`, `aesthetic_direction.style_family` |
| `tokens.` | `docs/DESIGN__tokens.yaml` | `tokens.color` → `DESIGN__tokens.yaml`.color |
| `assets.` | `docs/DESIGN__assets.yaml` (top level) | `assets.asset_taxonomy` |
| `asset.` | ONE entry in `DESIGN__assets.yaml.assets[]` — rewritten per asset in theme 4 | `asset.source` → `assets[i].source` |
| `brief.` | ONE asset's `generation_brief` — rewritten per `to_be_generated` asset in theme 5 | `brief.prompt` → `assets[i].generation_brief.prompt` |

In monorepo mode the target files are `DESIGN__<slug>__tokens.yaml` /
`DESIGN__<slug>__assets.yaml` for the product being interviewed.

## Importance tiers (`med | high | critical`)

Same mechanics as `sdlc:prd` — the canonical spec (per-item state machine,
draft-approve loop, scope-completeness sweep, EXIT-mid-flow) lives in
`sdlc/skills/prd/references/importance-flows.md`. Design-specific tier use:

- **`med`** — batched 2–4 per call. Most token sub-fields, brand fields, motion,
  taxonomy. `⚠ inferred` at position 1.
- **`high`** — own mini-section, agent drafts → user approves/iterates (cap 3).
  `aesthetic_direction.style_family` / `mood_keywords` / `requires_custom_assets`;
  the token `color` / `typography` groups; `assets.style_guide`; the brief
  `prompt` (critical, see below) / `style_anchors` / `acceptance_criteria`.
- **`critical`** — full per-item drill-down + scope-completeness sweep. The
  `asset_manifest.assets` inventory (theme 4) and each brief `prompt` (theme 5,
  per asset). See `references/asset-pipeline.md` for both state machines.

Within a theme, run all `med` questions first (in 2–4-question batches), then
each `high`/`critical` question as its own mini-section in file order. Write
state after each mini-section, exactly like after a batch.

## Conditional promotions (`required_if`)

Re-evaluate at the start of each theme against already-answered fields:

| Question / theme | Becomes active / required when |
|---|---|
| `aesthetic_direction` (theme) | `token_based_ui` or `asset_pipeline` ∈ functional_structure |
| `design_tokens` (theme) | `token_based_ui` ∈ functional_structure |
| `design_tokens.imported_from` | `tokens.token_source` is an `import_*` value |
| `asset_manifest` (theme) | `asset_pipeline` ∈ functional_structure OR `aesthetic_direction.requires_custom_assets` |
| `asset_generation_briefs` (theme) | ≥1 asset has `source == to_be_generated` |

When a theme is promoted, say so transparently:
> "Because the look is hand-drawn on a component UI, I've turned on the asset
> manifest — bespoke illustration/icon/texture assets are needed."

## Type discipline when writing answers

Many fields are *lists* (`mood_keywords`, `style_references`, `theme_modes`,
`recommended_tools`, `style_anchors`, `acceptance_criteria`, every ref list).
When the user multi-selects or types a multi-item answer (`;`, `,`, "and",
one-per-line), split into a proper YAML list. "none" for a list field → `[]`,
not the string `"none"`.

Token groups (`tokens.color`, `tokens.typography`, …) are **mappings**, written
DTCG-shaped (see `references/design-tokens.md`). Never serialize a token group
as a flat string.

## web_fetch usage

This skill may use `WebFetch` for two things, and must degrade gracefully when
it's unavailable or a fetch fails:

1. **Grounding `style_references`** — fetch a URL the user supplies, summarize
   its visual language (palette, type, layout, texture), and feed that into the
   aesthetic draft. **Never invent or guess URLs** — only fetch what the user
   gives or confirms.
2. **Preset import** — fetch a named shadcn theme / tailwind.config / Tokens
   Studio export the user points to and parse it into DTCG groups.

On any fetch failure: tell the user, proceed from their description instead, and
record a `WRN-NNN` note that the reference/preset wasn't fetched.

## Hallucination guard

`⚠ inferred` candidates are the **position-1 recommended option** and cannot be
silently accepted — the user must pick or correct. Applies to Phase 5 pre-fill,
theme 4 asset candidates, and every drafted brief. Refuse blanket "ok, all
good" shortcuts on `⚠` items; re-prompt per item.

## State-write timing

State is written after: every confirmed batch; every approved token group
(theme 3); every accepted asset and every completed sweep pass (theme 4); every
approved brief (theme 5); and on `EXIT` (`status: aborted`, partials flushed).
