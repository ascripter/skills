# Merge, validate, and the CLAUDE.md pointer

Detailed rules for Phase 7 (write & validate) and Phase 8 (pointer + close).
Read on entering Phase 7.

## What Phase 7 writes

Always `docs/DESIGN.yaml`. Plus, conditionally:

- `docs/DESIGN__tokens.yaml` — iff `token_based_ui` ∈ `functional_structure`.
- `docs/DESIGN__assets.yaml` — iff `asset_pipeline` ∈ `functional_structure`
  OR `aesthetic_direction.requires_custom_assets`.

Set `DESIGN.yaml.sub_artifacts.tokens` / `.assets` to the file paths you wrote
(and only when the composition rule holds — a stray pointer is an orphan the
validator rejects). A pure-headless product writes only `DESIGN.yaml` with
`aesthetic_direction: null` and both sub_artifacts null.

If a sub-file's content is still a draft at write time (the user EXIT'd mid-token
or mid-asset), write what exists with that file's `metadata.status: draft`; the
parent `DESIGN.yaml.metadata.status` is forced to `draft` too.

## Merging into existing files

If `docs/DESIGN.yaml` (or a sub-file) already exists:

- Load as baseline. Overwrite a key **only if the user changed it this session**;
  otherwise keep the existing value. Add new keys.
- Keys the session would remove → ask the user to confirm before deleting
  (especially dropping an asset, which orphans its brief).
- User-edited-on-disk vs state conflict on the same key → surface it, never
  auto-resolve:
  > "Conflict on `DESIGN.yaml.<key>`: file has `<a>`, interview state has `<b>`
  > (set <timestamp>). Which should I keep?"
- Preserve unrelated keys you don't recognise (`extra="allow"` tolerates them).

If `functional_structure` changed such that a sub-file is no longer needed (e.g.
the user dropped `asset_pipeline` and `requires_custom_assets` is false), ask
before deleting `DESIGN__assets.yaml` — don't silently remove a file with work
in it.

## Writing the files

- Inline YAML comments on top-level keys (use the `*.schema.yaml` files as
  templates). Updated `metadata.last_updated` + `session_id` on every file.
- **IDs**: assign `AST-NNN` to every asset (persist `state.last_ids.AST`); prefix
  every `design_warnings` entry `"WRN-NNN: <message>"` (persist
  `state.last_ids.WRN`). Store all upstream refs as ID strings only.
- **changelog** (append-only): in update mode, prepend ONE
  `"<version> (<YYYY-MM-DD>): <one-line summary>"` to each file changed. Never
  rewrite/reorder. Fresh write may omit it or seed `"<version> (<date>): initial."`.
- **upstream_provenance** (replace-on-write, DESIGN.yaml only): a snapshot for
  each upstream consumed — `docs/PRD.yaml` and `docs/UX.yaml` — each
  `{file, session_id, last_updated, sha256}`. `sha256` from
  `docs/INDEX.yaml.generated_from[<file>]`, else `sha256(bytes)[:16]`. See
  CLAUDE.md §7 and `sdlc/skills/ux/references/upstream-reconciliation.md`.
- **status**:
  - `complete` only when all required fields are filled, the validator passes
    `[OK]`, composition is consistent, and every `to_be_generated` asset is
    covered (brief or deferral).
  - `draft` on EXIT, any null required field, composition mismatch, or an
    uncovered asset.

## Running the validator

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/validate_schema.py" --path docs/DESIGN.yaml
```

One pass does six things: schema-validate `DESIGN.yaml`; discover + schema-
validate `DESIGN__*.yaml` siblings; required-field checks; ID-prefix formats
(AST/WRN/FR-or-NFR/SCR/ENT); **composition consistency**; **asset-brief
coverage** (trace-or-defer). It also prints advisory notes (e.g. an
`asset_type` not in `asset_taxonomy`) that never block `complete`.

| Code | Meaning | Agent action |
|---|---|---|
| 0 `[OK]` | complete, composition consistent, every asset covered | ✓ Proceed to Phase 8. |
| 0 `[DRAFT]` | draft — schema valid, maybe missing fields / coverage | Inform user; proceed to Phase 8 (pointer still injected). |
| 1 `[FAIL]` | schema invalid, OR `complete` with missing fields / composition error / id-prefix violation / uncovered asset | Show errors verbatim. Offer via `AskUserQuestion`: fix now, or accept `draft`. Re-validate after re-entry. |
| 2 | Cannot read/parse a file | Surface to user (missing file, bad YAML, permissions). Don't retry silently. |
| 3 | Missing dependency | Validator prints `pip install`. Ask user to install; don't auto-install. |

### Composition rules the validator enforces (per product scope)

- `headless` is exclusive — it can't co-occur with `token_based_ui`/`asset_pipeline`.
- `token_based_ui` selected ⟺ `sub_artifacts.tokens` set AND a tokens file on disk.
- `asset_pipeline` OR `requires_custom_assets` ⟺ `sub_artifacts.assets` set AND
  an assets file on disk.
- `aesthetic_direction` present unless `functional_structure == [headless]`.

### Coverage rule

Every asset with `source == to_be_generated` has a non-null `generation_brief`
OR a `design_warnings` entry naming its `AST-NNN`. A deferred asset counts as
covered (CLAUDE.md §6 trace-or-defer).

## CLAUDE.md pointer (Phase 8)

On validation exit 0, call `set_claude_md_pointer.py` (do NOT hand-edit
CLAUDE.md). Bullet (exact text the script writes):

```
- `docs/DESIGN.yaml` (+ `docs/DESIGN__tokens.yaml`, `docs/DESIGN__assets.yaml`): Visual design system — aesthetic direction, design tokens, and asset manifest. Load when styling surfaces, compiling tokens, or scaffolding assets. Last updated by `sdlc-design` on <ISO-8601 timestamp>.
```

Rules: create CLAUDE.md + section if absent; update the timestamp if a bullet
with both `` `docs/DESIGN.yaml` `` and `` `sdlc-design` `` exists; else append
the bullet at section end. **Never touch other sdlc-* bullets.**

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/set_claude_md_pointer.py"   # --dry-run to preview
```

## Refresh the index + close

If `.claude/sdlc/docs_index.py` exists, run `python .claude/sdlc/docs_index.py`
so `docs/INDEX.yaml` reflects the new DESIGN files immediately (the setup hook
also does this, but a mid-session hook only activates next session). Then set
state `status: complete`, keep the file, and tell the user:

> "Design spec written: `docs/DESIGN.yaml`" + the sub-files. "CLAUDE.md pointer
> updated. Downstream coding agents (and `sdlc:arch`/`sdlc:task`) can now style
> every surface and scaffold the asset pipeline from these."

## Downstream-agent contract

Downstream skills/agents MUST reject the design artifacts if
`DESIGN.yaml.metadata.status != "complete"` OR the validator exits non-zero.
