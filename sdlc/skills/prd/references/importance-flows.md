# Importance flows — running the interview by tier

Every question in `prd-questions.yaml` carries an `importance` field:
`med | high | critical | nested_freeform`. The tier dictates how the
agent runs the question — single batch entry, dedicated draft-approval
loop, full per-item drill-down, or per-bucket free-form drafting. Read
this file when entering Phase 6 alongside `interview-mechanics.md`.

The classification was made deliberately:

- **`critical`** is reserved for fields that define the MVP and the
  cross-cutting NFR set — currently
  `functional_requirements.must_have_features`,
  `functional_requirements.nice_to_have_features`, and
  `non_functional_requirements.other`. These warrant the most expensive
  interaction because every downstream agent will read them and treat
  them as scope-of-record. The flow is the per-item state machine plus
  a **dynamic scope-completeness sweep** before the list is closed
  (described below) so categories of items that are typical for *this
  specific project* but missing from the draft surface as concrete
  candidate items.
- **`high`** covers foundational narrative fields (e.g. `problem_statement`)
  and required list[string] fields (e.g. `core_workflows`, `primary_users`).
  Answers are expected to be longer than a single picked option, so the
  agent drafts the entry and the user approves or iterates.
- **`med`** is everything else — short strings, enums, bools, and well-
  bounded list[string] fields whose option menu covers most cases. These
  run inside ordinary 2–4-question `AskUserQuestion` batches per
  `interview-mechanics.md`.
- **`nested_freeform`** is for a single `Dict[str, Any]` field whose
  *shape* is project-defined — currently only `conventions`. The agent
  proposes named buckets inferred from prior answers and, for each
  bucket, drafts a free-form nested YAML body the user approves or
  iterates on. See "The nested_freeform flow" section below.

A question's `importance` does NOT change its `required` semantics —
required `med` fields are still required; optional `high`/`critical`/
`nested_freeform` fields are still skippable via the now/skip/todo gate.

## ID conventions across families

Several list[string] fields in `PRD.yaml` prefix each item with a stable
`<PREFIX>-NNN` identifier so that downstream SDLC artifacts (UX,
DATA-MODEL, API, ARCH, TEST-STRATEGY, TASKS) can cross-reference items
by ID. The agent assigns IDs in the order items are collected — never
mid-flow placeholders, never gaps.

### Family map

| Prefix | Field(s) — siblings share one continuous counter |
|---|---|
| `FR`  | `functional_requirements.must_have_features`, `nice_to_have_features` |
| `OOS` | `functional_requirements.out_of_scope` |
| `INT` | `functional_requirements.integrations_required` |
| `AIF` | `functional_requirements.ai_features` |
| `NFR` | `non_functional_requirements.performance_targets`, `other` |
| `WRN` | `prd_warnings` (top level — populated by the writer, not interviewed) |
| `PER` | `users_personas.primary_users`, `secondary_users` |
| `GOL` | `users_personas.user_goals` |
| `PAN` | `users_personas.user_frustrations` |
| `WKF` | `use_cases.core_workflows` |
| `JTB` | `use_cases.primary_jobs_to_be_done`, `secondary_jobs` |
| `EDG` | `use_cases.edge_cases` |
| `ENT` | `data_model.key_entities` |

### Rules (apply to every family)

- Format: `"<PREFIX>-NNN: <content>"` — three-digit zero-padded integers
  (`FR-001`, `FR-002`, …, `FR-010`, `FR-011`, …).
- IDs are unique within a family + scope. Sibling fields that share a
  counter (the "+" rows above) draw from one sequence: e.g. if
  `primary_users` ends at `PER-003`, `secondary_users` starts at `PER-004`.
- IDs are stable. Once written they never change. Promoting an item
  between sibling lists (nice-to-have → must-have, secondary → primary)
  means moving the string verbatim, not renumbering.
- In monorepo mode, each product carries its own independent ID space
  per family. Two products may each have `FR-001`; references are
  disambiguated by the `products.<slug>` path.

### State counters

The per-family counters live in `state.last_ids` (single-product) or
`state.last_ids_by_product` (monorepo). Persist them after each item is
written so EXIT/resume preserves gapless numbering. See `SKILL.md`'s
"Session state file" section for the schema.

### When the ID is assigned

The trigger differs by tier:

- **`med` (batched)**: when the agent serializes the user's batch response
  into the YAML list, it assigns IDs in collection order. The user
  doesn't see IDs during the question; they appear in the written file.
- **`high` (per-item draft-approval)**: at step 3 (*Add item*), the agent
  picks the next ID from the family counter, displays it back to the
  user as part of the appended item, and persists the counter.
- **`critical` (full per-item state machine)**: at step c (*Finalize*),
  the agent assigns the next ID at the moment of approval — see the
  `critical` section below for the exact moment.

The `validate_schema.py` script enforces format on every list item in
every registered family. Items without the prefix are warnings in
`status: draft` and errors in `status: complete`.

### `prd_warnings` (writer-populated, never interviewed)

The writer prepends `WRN-NNN:` to each warning when serializing the
list. Use a monotonic counter `state.last_ids.WRN`; persist after every
warning append.

## How batching changes with tier

`med` questions batch together (2–4 per `AskUserQuestion` call) inside
their theme. `high`, `critical`, and `nested_freeform` questions are
**never batched with others** — they each run as their own mini-section,
because their flow is multi-turn and cannot share a call with sibling
questions.

Inside a theme, run all `med` questions first (in 2–4-question batches),
then run each `high`/`critical`/`nested_freeform` question as its own
mini-section in the order they appear in `prd-questions.yaml`. Write
state after each mini-section completes, exactly like after a normal
batch.

## The `med` flow (default)

Unchanged from prior behavior. Each `med` question goes into an
`AskUserQuestion` batch alongside up to 3 sibling `med` questions from
the same theme. The `⚠ inferred` candidate (if any) is the position-1
option; the user picks an option, types free text into "Other", or
types `EXIT`. Set `<field>_confidence: confirmed` (explicit pick or
typed answer) or `inferred` (accepted as-is).

## The `high` flow

### Scalar `high` fields (string)

These are: `problem_opportunity.problem_statement`, `milestones.mvp_scope`.

1. **Propose.** Compose a 2–4-sentence draft from prior context. Print
   it to the chat preceded by a one-line agent comment explaining what
   you drew on, e.g. *"Based on the README excerpt and your earlier
   users_personas answers, here's a draft for problem_statement:"*.
2. **Ask for approval.** `AskUserQuestion` with one question, two
   options:

   ```
   header: "Approve?"
   question: "Approve this <field> as-is, or iterate?"
   options:
     - { label: "Approve as-is", description: "Write this to PRD.yaml and continue." }
     - { label: "Iterate — type changes", description: "Use the text field to describe what to change, add, or remove." }
   ```

3. **On approve.** Write the answer with `<field>_confidence: confirmed`.
4. **On iterate.** Re-draft using the user's free-text guidance. Repeat
   steps 1–3 with the new draft.
5. **Iteration cap.** After 3 iterations on a single field, write the
   current draft, append a one-line `prd_warnings` entry naming the
   field, and move on. The user can always re-run the skill in update
   mode to keep tweaking.

### List[string] `high` fields

These are: `users_personas.primary_users` (PER), `use_cases.core_workflows`
(WKF), `use_cases.primary_jobs_to_be_done` (JTB),
`functional_requirements.out_of_scope` (OOS),
`functional_requirements.integrations_required` (INT),
`functional_requirements.ai_features` (AIF),
`non_functional_requirements.other` (NFR),
`data_model.key_entities` (ENT),
`milestones.phases` (no ID family),
`risks_assumptions.top_risks` (no ID family).

Each item gets a lighter version of the per-item flow:

1. **Propose first item.** Suggest a candidate item (title + ≤ 1
   sentence description) drawn from prior context. Use
   `AskUserQuestion`:

   ```
   header: "Item 1"
   question: "First <field-singular> — does this look right?"
   options:
     - { label: "<inferred title>", description: "<one-sentence description>. Confirm to add as-is." }
     - { label: "Alternative 1",    description: "<other candidate>." }
     - { label: "Alternative 2",    description: "<other candidate>." }
     - { label: "Other / type",     description: "Type your own item in the text field." }
   ```

2. **One clarifying round (only if user typed free text or you flagged
   risk).** If the user typed a free-text item or you see a meaningful
   gap (e.g. ambiguous scope, missing constraint), ask one targeted
   clarifying `AskUserQuestion`. If the user picked a suggested option
   as-is, skip this step.

3. **Add item.** Look up the field's ID family in the table above. If the
   field has one, increment `state.last_ids.<PREFIX>` (or
   `state.last_ids_by_product[<slug>].<PREFIX>` in monorepo mode), format
   the new ID as `<PREFIX>-{:03d}`, and prepend it to the item so the
   stored string is `"<PREFIX>-NNN: <title — description>"`. Append to
   the running list and state-write (item + counter together). Fields
   that have no ID family (e.g. `milestones.phases`) are appended as
   plain strings.

4. **Next item or end.** Either suggest the next likely item (steps 1–3
   again, with item index incremented) or — if you've run out of
   suggestions — ask:

   ```
   header: "Add more?"
   question: "Add another <field-singular>, or wrap up <field>?"
   options:
     - { label: "Add another (I'll suggest)", description: "I'll propose a candidate next." }
     - { label: "Add my own",                  description: "Type the title in the text field." }
     - { label: "Done — wrap up <field>",      description: "Move on to the next question." }
   ```

5. **Cap.** Stop after the user picks "Done" or after 8 items
   (whichever first). For `core_workflows` the natural cap is 7 per
   schema; for others use 8 as a soft cap, then prompt the user
   explicitly if they want more.

After all items are collected, the list is the answer — no final
approval step is needed because every item was confirmed individually.

## The `critical` flow

Applies to:

- `functional_requirements.must_have_features` (FR-NNN family)
- `functional_requirements.nice_to_have_features` (FR-NNN family)
- `non_functional_requirements.other` (NFR-NNN family)

This is the full per-item state machine. Every item is challenged
before it's accepted, drafted with structured detail slots, and the
*list as a whole* is reflected on with a dynamic scope-completeness
sweep before it closes.

The shape of the per-item flow is identical across all three fields.
Only the **detail slots** (step b) and the **scope-sweep heuristics**
(step e) differ between FR-style lists and NFR-style lists — see those
sections below.

### Item IDs — assigned in step c

The relevant family per field:

| Field | Counter | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `functional_requirements.must_have_features` | `state.last_ids.FR` | Runs first; takes low FR-NNN numbers. |
| `functional_requirements.nice_to_have_features` | `state.last_ids.FR` | Continues from must_have_features. |
| `non_functional_requirements.other` | `state.last_ids.NFR` | Continues from `performance_targets`. |

The assignment moment is **step c (Finalize)**, not earlier — proposals
and detail drafts shown in steps a/b don't carry an ID yet. See "ID
conventions across families" above for the format rules and stability
guarantees that apply to all families.

In monorepo mode, replace `state.last_ids.<PREFIX>` with
`state.last_ids_by_product[<slug>].<PREFIX>` throughout.

### Per-item state machine

For each item in the list:

#### Step a — propose or accept a candidate

`AskUserQuestion` with the inferred candidate as position-1, 2–3
alternatives the agent considers plausible, and "Other / type your own"
as the last option. The item at this stage is *title + ≤ 1 sentence
description only* — detail comes later.

```
header: "<Family> N"      # e.g. "Feature N", "NFR N"
question: "<Field-singular> #N — pick one or type your own."
options:
  - { label: "⚠ <inferred title>",   description: "⚠ <one-sentence description>. Drawn from <prior-answer source>." }
  - { label: "<alt candidate 1>",    description: "<one-sentence description>." }
  - { label: "<alt candidate 2>",    description: "<one-sentence description>." }
  - { label: "Other — type your own", description: "Use the text field. The agent will challenge it before accepting." }
```

If the user picks a suggested option → go to **step b** (skip a-2).
If the user types free text → go to **step a-2** (challenge it first).

#### Step a-2 — challenge (free-text only)

Look at the user's typed item against everything answered so far. If
you see a meaningful risk — scope ambiguity, dependency conflict,
contradiction with `out_of_scope` / `users_personas` / earlier NFRs,
technical infeasibility under the chosen stack — surface it in **one**
`AskUserQuestion`:

```
header: "Risk check"
question: "Before adding '<user's text>', one concern: <risk>. How do you want to handle it?"
options:
  - { label: "<proposed resolution 1>", description: "<one-sentence explanation>." }
  - { label: "<proposed resolution 2>", description: "<one-sentence explanation>." }
  - { label: "Keep as-is anyway",       description: "Accept the item without changing it. A note will be added to prd_warnings." }
  - { label: "Reword — type",           description: "Type a revised title/description in the text field." }
```

If you don't see a concrete risk, skip this step. Don't manufacture
risks — challenge is for adding signal, not for forcing iteration.

#### Step b — detail with structured slots

Now expand the item from title → full entry. The goal is a *verbose*
stored string (typically 2–6 sentences, longer when warranted) that
downstream agents can read once and understand the full intent without
re-reading the interview transcript. Draft the detail by mentally
filling **structured slots** before writing the prose; you don't need
to label slots in the stored string, but every slot that *applies*
should be reflected in the prose.

**Slots for FR-style items** (`must_have_features`, `nice_to_have_features`):

| Slot | What to capture |
|---|---|
| Input(s)        | What the feature consumes — upstream artifact, user gesture, event. Reference upstream IDs (ENT-###, FR-###, SCR-###, etc.) where known. |
| Output(s)       | What the feature produces — artifact, response, side effect. |
| Dependencies    | Other FR-### / INT-### / NFR-### this feature relies on or composes with. |
| Edge cases / special modes | No-op behavior, fallback paths, multi-mode behavior (e.g. headless vs GUI), failure handling. |
| Why this matters | The downstream reason this is non-deferrable — what would break or be lost without it. |

**Slots for NFR-style items** (`non_functional_requirements.other`):

| Slot | What to capture |
|---|---|
| Scope           | Which CNT-### / CMP-### / FR-### / artifact-type this NFR applies to (the *boundary* of the constraint). |
| Threshold or criterion | The concrete bar — value, predicate, invariant. Avoid hand-wavy "good enough"; state the actual rule. |
| Measurement     | How conformance is verified — gate check, test category, manual review, structural property. |
| Downstream impact | Which downstream stage(s) must consult this — Architecture, Test Strategy, Deployment, etc. (Mirrors the role of `conventions.nfr_propagation` if that bucket exists.) |
| Why this matters | What breaks if the constraint isn't honored — determinism leak, audit failure, resumability loss, etc. |

Slot guidance is *internal* to the agent: surface 2–3 detail candidates
that each cover the applicable slots, plus the free-text option. Don't
ask the user "fill in these slots" — just make sure the candidate
drafts you propose *do* cover them.

```
header: "Detail"
question: "Detail for '<title>' — pick the framing or write your own."
options:
  - { label: "⚠ <detailed candidate 1>", description: "⚠ <2–6 sentence detailed spec covering applicable slots>." }
  - { label: "<detailed candidate 2>",    description: "<alternative framing — different slot emphasis>." }
  - { label: "<detailed candidate 3>",    description: "<alternative framing — narrower or broader scope>." }
  - { label: "Other — type the full detail", description: "Use the text field." }
```

If the user picks a suggested option → go to **step c** (skip b-2).
If the user types free text → go to **step b-2**.

#### Step b-2 — second-pass clarification (free-text only)

If the user's free-text detail leaves a meaningful gap (a slot that
*should* apply is missing, contradicts something earlier, or is
ambiguous), ask **one** more `AskUserQuestion` to pin down the missing
slot. Otherwise proceed to step c. Do not loop here — at most one b-2
round.

Skip this step if the user's free text already covers the applicable
slots — slot completeness is the bar, not slot labeling.

#### Step c — finalize

Print the drafted entry to the chat as a YAML snippet showing exactly
how it will be stored. **Assign the next ID now** (increment the
relevant counter — see the table at the top of this section — and
format as `<PREFIX>-{:03d}`). The stored format merges title and detail
into one string:

```yaml
# Item about to be added (<PREFIX>-NNN assigned on approval):
- "FR-003: OAuth2 login — users authenticate via Google or GitHub. Input:
   user click on a provider button (SCR-002). Output: a session cookie
   (ENT-007) plus a short-lived access token with refresh-token rotation.
   Dependencies: INT-002 (OAuth provider), NFR-004 (session timeout).
   Edge: when the provider returns no email scope, fall back to manual
   email entry. Why: removing password storage cuts our attack surface
   and matches user expectation for B2B SaaS."
```

Then ask:

```
header: "Approve <PREFIX>-NNN?"
question: "Add <PREFIX>-NNN to <field>?"
options:
  - { label: "Approve — add it",         description: "Append <PREFIX>-NNN to the list and move on." }
  - { label: "Iterate — type changes",   description: "Use the text field to describe what to change. The agent will re-draft." }
```

On approve: write `"<PREFIX>-NNN: <merged title + detail>"` to the list
and persist the counter.
On iterate: re-enter step b with the user's revision as new context; the
ID is tentatively held but not written until the next approval.
**Iteration cap**: after 3 c-iterations on a single item, write the
current draft with the assigned ID, add a `prd_warnings` entry naming
the item, and proceed to step d.

#### Step d — next item or end

Once an item is approved (or capped):

- If you can think of another likely item from the user's prior
  answers, propose it directly via step a again (with the next item
  index).
- If you've exhausted your suggestions, ask:

  ```
  header: "Add more?"
  question: "Add another <field-singular>, or are we done with this list?"
  options:
    - { label: "Add another (I'll suggest)", description: "I'll propose a candidate next." }
    - { label: "Add my own",                  description: "Type the title; we'll work through it from step a-2." }
    - { label: "Done — wrap up the list",     description: "Trigger the scope-completeness sweep, then move on." }
  ```

When the user picks "Done", do **not** close the list yet — run step e
first.

#### Step e — dynamic scope-completeness sweep

This is the gate that catches items the user (and the agent so far)
forgot. It is **dynamic and project-specific**: don't use any canned
checklist. Instead, take a reflective pass over:

1. **The draft list itself** (what's been added so far) — what kinds of
   items dominate? What kinds are conspicuously absent given the
   prior answers?
2. **All upstream answers** (`problem_opportunity`, `users_personas`,
   `use_cases`, `technical_constraints`, earlier critical lists,
   structural questions from Phase 4) — what do they imply about
   features/NFRs that haven't surfaced yet?
3. **The project type** — a CLI tool, a SaaS app, a mobile-first
   product, a library, an internal data pipeline, and an
   AI-orchestration framework each have very different "things people
   forget" surfaces. Let the project's own profile drive your
   suggestions.

The sweep produces **concrete candidate items**, not category labels.
"You might be missing audit logging" beats "have you considered
observability"; "cross-branch session isolation" beats "have you
considered concurrency". The user is going to read these and decide
in one click each, so name the thing.

Format the sweep as **one** `AskUserQuestion` call surfacing the agent's
top 2–4 candidate items. Add 1–2 sentences of preamble in the question
text explaining what you noticed.

```
header: "Scope sweep"
question: "Looking at your N <field-singular>s alongside <one-line
  reflection of what you drew on>, a few candidates look notable that
  aren't on the list yet. Add any of these, or wrap up?"
options:
  - { label: "⚠ <candidate item 1 — short title>", description: "⚠ <one-sentence why-it-might-belong>. Pick to draft it through steps a-2 → c." }
  - { label: "⚠ <candidate item 2 — short title>", description: "⚠ <one-sentence why-it-might-belong>." }
  - { label: "⚠ <candidate item 3 — short title>", description: "⚠ <one-sentence why-it-might-belong>." }
  - { label: "Wrap up — list is complete",         description: "Skip these. The list closes as-is." }
```

(Multi-select if your `AskUserQuestion` call supports it for this
question, so the user can pick more than one candidate at once.)

For each picked candidate: re-enter the state machine at **step a-2**
(treat the candidate as user-typed free text that the agent already
flagged; you may skip the risk-check if the candidate is self-evidently
clean) → b → c. Then return to step e for a second pass.

**Caps for the sweep:**

- At most **2 sweep passes** per list. After two passes, even if you
  still see candidates, defer them to a `prd_warnings` entry:
  `"<field>: sweep suggested but not added — <candidate>, <candidate>"`
  and close the list. The user can re-run the skill in update mode if
  they want more.
- **No sweep at all** if the user added 0 items in step a/b/c (an
  empty critical list is its own signal — don't push). Surface a
  single `prd_warnings` note instead: `"<field>: empty list — no items
  collected"`.
- For very short lists (1–2 items), still run one sweep pass — short
  lists are exactly when forgotten items are most likely.

**Anti-padding rule:** if you don't see *concrete* candidates after
honest reflection, surface 0 — close the list without a sweep question.
Don't manufacture candidates to look thorough.

#### Confidence after step e

Items added during the sweep get `confidence: inferred` (the agent
proposed them; the user accepted but didn't originate them). If the
user edited the sweep candidate in step b's free-text path, promote to
`confirmed` as usual.

### Caps (per-list)

- **Soft cap**: 10 items per critical list (per the schema hint
  `must_have_features` = 3–10). The sweep can take a list past 10 if the
  user keeps picking candidates; that's intentional.
- **Hard cap**: 20. After that, refuse politely and suggest moving
  some to `nice_to_have_features` (for FR) or splitting the NFR list
  into more focused buckets.

### State-write timing

Write state after:

- each item's step c approval (single-item granularity), and
- each completed sweep pass (so partial sweeps survive EXIT).

This keeps `EXIT` cheap.

### Confidence (list-level)

Items added via step a (user picked a suggestion as-is) get
`confidence: inferred`. Items that went through any free-text
iteration get `confidence: confirmed`. The whole list inherits the
*lowest* confidence of its items if you record list-level confidence.

## The `nested_freeform` flow

Currently applies only to the `conventions` field. The output is a
`Dict[str, Any]` whose shape is project-defined — named buckets where
each bucket's sub-structure is *not* fixed by the schema. The
validator only type-checks the top-level mapping; everything inside is
up to the project.

This tier exists because the existing `critical` flow assumes "title
plus detail merges into one string item with an assigned `<PREFIX>-NNN`
ID". That shape is wrong for conventions, where each bucket has its
own free-form nested body (scalars, lists, maps — whatever the project
needs) and has no ID.

### Run as the LAST mini-section of its theme

`conventions` lives in its own theme at the end of `prd-questions.yaml`,
after `open_questions`. By the time this question runs, the agent has
seen every other answer and can spot cross-cutting patterns that
downstream stages must honor verbatim.

### Per-bucket state machine

#### Step a — propose convention bucket names

Reflect on everything answered so far. What cross-cutting rules have
emerged that downstream stages will need to honor identically? Common
sources of bucket candidates:

- The user mentioned an ID/naming scheme that spans multiple lists
  (FR-### referenced across stages, ENT-### feeding API, etc.) →
  candidate bucket `artifact_ids` or similarly named.
- The user mentioned schema/artifact versioning → candidate bucket
  `schema_versioning`.
- A list of NFRs references downstream stages by name → candidate
  bucket `nfr_propagation` (which downstream stage must read which
  PRD field).
- A code-style or testing rule keeps surfacing → candidate bucket
  `code_style` or `testing_policy`.

Surface 2–4 candidate bucket names via one `AskUserQuestion` (multi-
select). Always include "Done — no conventions / no more conventions"
as an explicit option:

```
header: "Conventions"
question: "Any binding cross-cutting conventions downstream stages must
  honor? Pick any candidates you want to define, or wrap up."
options:
  - { label: "⚠ artifact_ids",      description: "⚠ The cross-stage ID rules you've mentioned (FR-###, ENT-###, …). Pick to draft the bucket body next." }
  - { label: "⚠ schema_versioning", description: "⚠ Per-artifact versioning policy and migration rules." }
  - { label: "⚠ nfr_propagation",   description: "⚠ Map of which NFR/PRD fields each downstream stage must read." }
  - { label: "Done — wrap up",      description: "No (more) conventions to define. Close the conventions block." }
```

The user can also type a bucket name in the free-text field that the
agent didn't propose. For each accepted bucket name → step b. After
all buckets are drafted, return here for another pass (max 2 passes
total — see "Caps" below).

**Anti-padding rule:** if you genuinely don't see any cross-cutting
convention worth surfacing (small CLI, single-script utility, etc.),
ask **one** `AskUserQuestion` with options `["Define conventions
manually — type bucket name", "Skip conventions — none apply"]` and let
the user opt in.

#### Step b — draft the bucket body

For each accepted bucket name, draft a free-form nested YAML body that
captures the rule. The body shape is *project-defined* — it can be a
scalar, a list, a flat map, a nested map, or any combination. The agent
picks the shape that best expresses the rule, drawing on prior answers.

Show the draft to the user as a YAML snippet in the chat preceded by a
one-line agent comment about what you drew on:

```
"Based on the FR-### and ENT-### references in your must_have_features
and your earlier mention of stable IDs, here's a draft for the
`artifact_ids` bucket:"

```yaml
conventions:
  artifact_ids:
    binding: true
    description: "Canonical 3-letter cross-stage IDs..."
    scope:
      - "Every stage artifact that emits or references one of the id_types"
    id_types:
      FR: "Functional Requirement — ..."
      ENT: "Data Entity — ..."
```

Then ask via `AskUserQuestion`:

```
header: "Approve?"
question: "Approve this `<bucket>` body, or iterate?"
options:
  - { label: "Approve as-is",           description: "Write to conventions.<bucket> and move on." }
  - { label: "Iterate — type changes",  description: "Use the text field to describe what to change, add, or remove. The agent will re-draft." }
```

On approve → write `conventions.<bucket>` with the drafted body.
On iterate → re-draft with the user's free-text guidance. Repeat
steps b–approve up to 3 times.

**Iteration cap**: after 3 b-iterations on a single bucket, write the
current draft, append a one-line `prd_warnings` entry naming the bucket,
and move on to the next bucket (or step c).

#### Step c — loop or close

After each bucket completes, loop back to step a with the buckets
already written excluded from the candidate list. The user can keep
adding buckets until they pick "Done — wrap up" or until the caps
trigger.

### Caps (per `conventions` block)

- **Sweep-pass cap**: 2 passes through step a maximum. After two passes
  even if you still see candidates, defer them to `prd_warnings`:
  `"conventions: sweep suggested but not added — <bucket>, <bucket>"`
  and close the block.
- **Bucket count cap**: 8 buckets maximum. Beyond that, refuse politely
  and suggest the user collapses related buckets or accepts the rest
  as `prd_warnings`.
- **Empty conventions**: writing `conventions: null` (or omitting the
  key entirely) is fine — most simple projects have no binding
  cross-cutting rules. Don't push.

### State-write timing

Write state after **each bucket's approval in step b**, not at the end
of the whole block. This keeps `EXIT` cheap. The on-disk shape of the
state's `partial_answers.conventions` mirrors the output YAML.

### Validation

The validator (`validate_schema.py`) only checks that `conventions` is
either `null` or a `Dict[str, Any]`. It does not enforce sub-keys,
value types, or nesting depth — those are deliberately project-defined.

The ID-family check skips `conventions` entirely. Items inside
conventions are *not* expected to carry `<PREFIX>-NNN` prefixes — they
are addressed by bucket name and sub-path.

## product_identity — the synthesis batch

`product_identity` is asked LAST among required themes so the agent has
rich context by the time it runs. All `product_identity` fields are
`med` (the heavy lifting was already done by `product_identity.idea_text`,
captured verbatim in Phase 3). They run as a single `AskUserQuestion`
batch where every candidate option is `⚠ inferred` from prior answers.

Example:

```
AskUserQuestion(questions=[
  {
    header: "Identity",
    question: "What is the product's name? (Synthesized from your prior answers.)",
    options: [
      { label: "⚠ flowcraft", description: "⚠ Inferred from your assembly metaphor. Pick to confirm or use text field to correct." },
      { label: "⚠ mosaic",    description: "⚠ Pieces composing into a whole." },
      { label: "⚠ loom",      description: "⚠ Weaving workflows together." },
      { label: "Custom name", description: "Type your preferred name in the text field." }
    ]
  },
  {
    header: "Identity",
    question: "Preferred URL/package slug? (kebab-case)",
    options: [
      { label: "⚠ flowcraft", description: "⚠ Auto-derived from inferred name. Confirm or correct." },
      { label: "Custom slug", description: "Type a kebab-case slug in the text field." }
    ]
  },
  {
    header: "Identity",
    question: "Describe the product in one sentence (≤ 140 chars).",
    options: [
      { label: "⚠ Inferred one-liner", description: "⚠ \"Compose AI workflows visually, run them anywhere — even offline.\" Confirm or correct." },
      { label: "Custom one-liner", description: "Type your own in the text field." }
    ]
  }
])
```

**Hallucination guard**: all `⚠`-marked options require explicit
pick-or-correct from the user. Accepting one counts as confirmation;
the user can also use the "Other" field to correct. Never treat a
non-answer as implicit acceptance.

Explicitly call out in the batch header that candidates were
synthesized from prior answers — don't present them as facts.

## When the user EXITs mid-flow

`EXIT` works at every `AskUserQuestion` call regardless of tier. On
exit:

- For a `med` question: no special handling; state is written after the
  batch the question lived in, so the question's prior batch is saved.
- For a `high` mini-section: write whatever has been collected so far
  (e.g. the partial list for list[string] fields, or no value at all
  if no item was approved). Mark the field's `<field>_confidence` as
  `assumption` if any partial content was written.
- For a `critical` mini-section: write the partially-approved items
  to the list. The unfinished current item is dropped (not written
  partial). If EXIT arrives mid-sweep (step e), write the items
  collected so far; do not finalize the sweep pass. Set
  `<field>_confidence: assumption`. Add a `prd_warnings` entry:
  `"<field>: list incomplete — EXIT received mid-item N"` (or
  `"<field>: list incomplete — EXIT received mid-sweep pass M"`).
- For a `nested_freeform` mini-section: write the buckets that were
  fully approved (`conventions.<bucket-name>` complete). The
  unfinished current bucket is dropped (not written partial). Add a
  `prd_warnings` entry: `"conventions: incomplete — EXIT received
  while drafting bucket '<name>'"`.

Then proceed with the normal abort flow from `interview-mechanics.md`:
set `status: aborted`, save state, confirm to user, stop.
