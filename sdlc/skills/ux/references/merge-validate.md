# Merge, validate, and the CLAUDE.md pointer

Detailed rules for Phase 7 (write & validate) and Phase 8 (CLAUDE.md
pointer). Read this when entering Phase 7.

## What Phase 7 writes

Phase 7 always writes **at least two files** for a non-trivial product:

1. `docs/UX.yaml` — the global UX contract.
2. One `docs/UX__<surface_id>.yaml` per confirmed surface in
   `state.defined_surfaces`.

If a surface's status is still `draft` at write time (the user
EXIT'd mid-deep-dive or explicitly chose "Skip for now"), do NOT write
that surface yaml. The inventory entry stays in `UX.yaml` with
`status: draft`, the coverage check will surface any PRD flow it was
supposed to cover, and `UX.yaml.metadata.status` is forced to `draft`.

## Merging into an existing UX.yaml + surface files

If `docs/UX.yaml` already exists:

- Load it as the baseline.
- Merge the session's confirmed answers on top:
  - **Keys present in both** — overwrite *only* if the user changed
    the value during this session. Otherwise keep the existing value.
  - **New keys** — add them.
  - **Keys the session would remove** — ask the user to confirm
    before deleting.

If `docs/UX__<surface_id>.yaml` already exists:

- Load it as the surface baseline.
- Merge the session's confirmed per-surface answers on top with the
  same overwrite/add/remove logic.

If the session's `surface_inventory` would **remove a surface** that
previously existed:

> "I'm about to remove surface `<surface_id>` from the inventory.
> This will delete `docs/UX__<surface_id>.yaml`. Proceed?"

Wait for explicit confirmation before deleting the file.

If the user manually edited an artifact between sessions and state
file disagrees on a specific key, surface the conflict — do NOT
silently pick:

> "Conflict on `UX.yaml.<key>`:
>   UX.yaml has: `<a>`
>   Interview state has: `<b>` (set at <timestamp>)
> Which should I keep?"

Always preserve **unrelated keys** in the existing YAML files even if
you don't recognise them. The validator's `extra="allow"` config means
custom keys are tolerated.

## Writing the files

For `UX.yaml`:

- Inline YAML comments on each top-level key (use `UX.schema.yaml` as a
  template).
- Updated `metadata.last_updated` (ISO-8601 UTC) and
  `metadata.session_id`.
- `metadata.status`:
  - Set to `"complete"` only when:
    1. all required fields are filled,
    2. the validator passes with `[OK]` (schema + ID-prefix format),
    3. every WKF-NNN parsed from `PRD.use_cases.core_workflows` is
       referenced by at least one surface's `traces_workflows`.
  - Set to `"draft"` on early EXIT, when any required field is null,
    OR when any PRD WKF-NNN is uncovered.
- `metadata.changelog`: append-only. When running in update mode (an
  existing UX.yaml is on disk), prepend ONE entry summarizing this
  session's material changes in the format
  `"<ux_version> (<YYYY-MM-DD>): <one-line summary>"`. Never rewrite
  earlier entries; never reorder; never delete. On a brand-new write
  (no existing UX.yaml), the changelog may be omitted entirely or
  initialized with a single `"<ux_version> (<YYYY-MM-DD>): initial."`
  entry — both are valid.
- `ux_warnings`: informational notes, each prefixed with a writer-
  managed `WRN-NNN:`. Used for uncovered PRD WKF-NNN, low-confidence
  answers, merge conflicts, dropped optional themes (the now/skip/todo
  gates), sweep candidates the user deferred, and any other note
  downstream agents should see. The counter lives in
  `state.last_ids.WRN` (or `state.last_ids_by_product[<slug>].WRN`
  in monorepo mode).

For each `UX__<surface_id>.yaml`:

- Inline comments on top-level keys.
- Updated metadata (`last_updated`, `session_id`).
- `metadata.changelog`: same append-only rule as UX.yaml.
- `metadata.status: complete` only when all required surface fields
  are filled (`id` = SCR-NNN, `surface_id`, `surface_type`, `layout`,
  `traces_workflows` — may be `[]` for non-flow surfaces) AND the user
  explicitly approved in theme 11 step e. The validator additionally
  enforces SCR-NNN format on `id` and WKF/FR/ENT format on each ref
  list.

## Running the validator

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/validate_schema.py" --path docs/UX.yaml
```

The validator does four things in one pass:

1. Schema-validates `docs/UX.yaml`.
2. Schema-validates every `docs/UX__*.yaml` sibling.
3. ID-prefix format checks: `SCR-NNN` on every surface id (in both
   `surface_inventory[].id` and per-surface top-level `id`); `WRN-NNN:
   <message>` on every `ux_warnings` entry; `WKF-NNN` on values in
   `traces_workflows`; `FR-NNN` on values in `implements_requirements`
   and in `cli.exit_codes[<code>].implements_requirements`; `ENT-NNN`
   on values in `references_entities`. Violations are warnings when
   `status: draft`, errors when `status: complete`.
4. Coverage check: every WKF-NNN id parsed from
   `PRD.use_cases.core_workflows` (read from `docs/PRD.yaml` directly,
   not from state) must be referenced by at least one surface yaml's
   `traces_workflows`. Matching is by id only — verbatim text in PRD
   may change freely without breaking the coverage. Uncovered ids are
   surfaced in the output.

Exit codes:

| Code | Meaning | What the agent does |
|---|---|---|
| 0 (`[OK]`) | UX.yaml is complete, all surfaces valid, every PRD flow covered | ✓ Proceed to Phase 8. |
| 0 (`[DRAFT]`) | Draft — schema valid, possibly missing required fields or coverage | Inform user; proceed to Phase 8 (pointer still injected). |
| 1 (`[FAIL]`) | Schema invalid, OR `status: complete` but required fields missing, OR `status: complete` but coverage incomplete | Show field-level errors verbatim. Offer via `AskUserQuestion`: fix now, or accept `status: draft`. Re-run validation after re-entry. |
| 2 | Cannot read/parse one of the files | Surface to user (missing file, bad YAML, permission error). Do not retry silently. |
| 3 | Missing dependency | Validator prints `pip install` instructions. Ask the user to install and re-run; do NOT auto-install. |

**Downstream-agent contract**: downstream skills/agents MUST reject the
UX artifacts if `UX.yaml.metadata.status != "complete"` OR if the
validator exits non-zero. Document this in CLAUDE.md if the user asks.

## Coverage-check details

The coverage check reads `docs/PRD.yaml` and extracts the WKF-NNN id
prefix from each entry in `use_cases.core_workflows` (or, in monorepo
mode, the union across products). PRD entries are of the form
`"WKF-NNN: <description>"`; the leading id is extracted via regex. A
WKF-NNN id is **covered** when it appears verbatim in at least one
surface yaml's `traces_workflows` list. Matching is on the id only —
the description text in PRD may change freely without breaking the
trace.

If `docs/PRD.yaml` is missing, the validator continues without the
coverage check and prints `0 PRD WKF-NNN(s) discovered.` so the user
knows it wasn't run.

Any uncovered WKF-NNN:

1. Appears in the validator's output ("PRD WKF-NNN(s) with no surface
   trace").
2. Must be written to `UX.yaml.ux_warnings` by the agent during Phase 7
   *before* validation runs, as a `WRN-NNN:` entry, e.g.
   `"WRN-007: coverage: WKF-008 has no surface trace"`. The WRN-NNN is
   assigned from `state.last_ids.WRN` (writer-managed counter).
3. Forces `UX.yaml.metadata.status: draft`.

## CLAUDE.md pointer (Phase 8)

On validation exit code 0 (either `[OK]` or `[DRAFT]`), call
`set_claude_md_pointer.py` (bundled with this skill) to inject or
update the skill's bullet inside the shared `## SDLC Documents`
section of the project-root `CLAUDE.md`. The script is deterministic —
do not write to `CLAUDE.md` by hand.

**Bullet format** (exactly as produced by the pointer script):

```
- `docs/UX.yaml` (+ `docs/UX__<surface>.yaml`): UX surfaces, flows, components, and states. Load when working on UI implementation, flow wiring, or component contracts. Last updated by `sdlc-ux` on <ISO-8601 timestamp>.
```

**Rules** (mirrored from CLAUDE.md project conventions):

- If `CLAUDE.md` does not exist → create it containing only the
  `## SDLC Documents` heading and this bullet.
- If `CLAUDE.md` exists but the `## SDLC Documents` section does not →
  append a blank line, the heading, and this bullet at the end.
- If the section exists and a bullet that contains BOTH
  `` `docs/UX.yaml` `` AND `` `sdlc-ux` `` already exists → update the
  timestamp only; do not duplicate.
- If the section exists but no matching bullet → append the bullet as
  the last line of the section.
- Never reorder or modify the user's existing CLAUDE.md content.
- **Never touch other sdlc-* skills' bullets** (e.g. `sdlc-prd` and
  `sdlc-arch` bullets must be left exactly as they were).

Invoke as:

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/set_claude_md_pointer.py"
# add --dry-run to preview the diff without writing
```

## Closing the session

After Phase 8's CLAUDE.md write succeeds:

- Set `status: complete` in the state file.
- Keep the state file as an audit trail — do **not** delete it.
- Tell the user the workflow finished and where the artifacts live:
  *"UX spec written: `docs/UX.yaml` plus N surface files. CLAUDE.md
  pointer updated. The downstream `sdlc:api` skill can now consume
  these artifacts."*
